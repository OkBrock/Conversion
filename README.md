# Conversion

Task:
        Create a program where the user can input a number of inches and receive a conversion
        to miles, feet, kilometers, meters, centimeters, and millimeters.
        - Accept decimals and print out decimals
        - User-friendly with a description (in the output)

        Reference:
        1 mile = 5,280 ft = 1,760 yards = 1,609.34 m = 1.609 km
        1 ft = 12 inches = 0.305 m = 30.48 cm
        1 inch = 2.54 cm = 25.4 mm
        1 km = 1,000 m = 0.621 miles
        1 m = 39.37 inches = .3281 ft = 1.094 yards
        1 cm = 10 mm = 0.394 inches
        1 mm = 0.04 inches

Preface: The conversions were not consistent (inches / 39.37 gives meters, feet / 5280 gives miles)
